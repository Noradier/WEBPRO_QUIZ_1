                        Though there is no significant tourist spot in Maumere, Sikka Regency has many beaches serving as tourist attractor.
                        One such beach is Koka Beach. The beach has white sand and clear water. It also is not crowded, usually.
                        Unfortunately, I cannot give any more description than that such as activities, local restaurant or hostel.
                        Though I visited once, my time there was limited.
