                        Jagung Bose is a dish served here. It is a traditional dish in Nusa Tenggara Timur. 
                        It is a corn dish in the form of grits.  This dish contains a mixture of red beans and peanuts in it. 
                        It also contains coconut milk which adds the delicacy of the porridge. 
                        Jagung Bose can also act as substitution for rice in some occasions.

                        Since it is close to sea, Maumere also serves seafood. 
                        There are fish, crab, shrimp, lobster, and squid dishes. Unlike most seafoods served, these dishes are cheaper by a large margin. 
                        However, their quality is on par, if not better than ones in eastern Asia countries.
